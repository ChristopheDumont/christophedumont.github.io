    <p>Hello, for my GIP assignment English “A review” I have chosen the application XenClient from CITRIX. The reason why I have chosen this application is because we had to choose one from our training company, and this application was frequently used in mine. I only saw the basics of XenClient, but thanks to dear Google (I crossed this site which explained a lot more <a href="http://windowsitpro.com/virtualization/product-review-citrix-xenclient-enterprise-51">http://windowsitpro.com/virtualization/product-review-citrix-xenclient-enterprise-51</a>) I’ve learned a lot more, and I found out it’s actually a huge thing!</p>

<p>So what is this CITRIX XenClient and what is it used for? “Citrix XenClient is a Type 1 (or bare metal) client hypervisor from software provider Citrix Systems. Citrix XenClient virtual machines (VMs) are managed with a product called Citrix Synchronizer.” (Source definition: <a href="http://searchvirtualdesktop.techtarget.com/definition/Citrix-XenClient">http://searchvirtualdesktop.techtarget.com/definition/Citrix-XenClient</a>) And now come a lot of very IT-related statements. The Citrix XenClient is a tool which allows virtual machines to be shared to other virtual machines and they can be accessed by multiple virtual machines. Those virtual machines can easily be hosted by the XenClient. The Synchronizer they speak of applies the changes you make to the virtual machines on the XenClient. The Synchronizer can also backup, deploy virtual machines and utilize image layering technology. It allows users to access another PC over the internet and make changes on that PC while sitting at home or at work. At my training company they used it to help out a customer who had a problem with his PC. So they could talk to them over the phone and browse around their PC searching for the problem and applying solutions/fixes.</p>

<p>I found this tool to be very interesting, and it surely is very recommended for companies which offer customer support. The review I used to get more information provided some very good pros and cons about the tool. For example as a pro: “The IT can easily control and manage user laptops, computers and tablets remotely.”. Having that as a pro makes it suitable for use. Creating and deploying new virtual machines with XenClient is a piece of cake. They also reported that the XenClient is rather expensive, it having a minimum price of $1070 and very high system requirements. Anyhow, I think the price is worth it for an investment for better customer support. Because regardless of the network connection being very well or awfully bad, the new version only requires your own network as everything is done locally!</p>

<p>Despite having an expensive license, having high system requirements, not so clear documentation about how to deploy something, I think this tool is a must-have for support desks at a company. It’s really cool too, and the technology behind it must be very complex! Sadly I couldn’t see more advanced things about it at my training company, it’s really interesting. I give this tool a well deserved <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>.</p>
