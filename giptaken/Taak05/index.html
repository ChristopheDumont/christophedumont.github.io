<h1 id="introduction:4c5b3b485fa30b2f5b47fbff7329b01f">Introduction</h1>

<p>I’m Christophe Dumont, I’m 17 years old. My school is Immaculata Instituut in Oostmalle. I’ve been interested in computers since I was little. When my dad bought himself one, I used it way more than him. So that made me to the “Computer genius” I am now, my dearest friends call me that when they see me busy so I thought it was a cool nickname to live with.</p>

<h1 id="how-it-all-began:4c5b3b485fa30b2f5b47fbff7329b01f">How it all began</h1>

<p>Like I said in my introduction, my dad bought himself a PC but I was the one using it the most. I was 6 years old. My very first impression was how huge and heavy the case was. The next day I saw how my dad was using it and it enchanted me. I told my friends all about it and because their parents also had a PC, they told me several sites to visit. For example sites full of flash games: Spele.be, Miniclip.com, Kongregate.com, … and so on. I quickly learned my way around with my PC (actually my dad’s).  Years later, I started to use Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. Then I began customizing (personalizing) my dashboard. I learned everything about it, from looking up info to actually finding it myself without needing help.</p>

<h1 id="what-it-means-to-me-today:4c5b3b485fa30b2f5b47fbff7329b01f">What IT means to me today</h1>

<p>I had to ‘wait’ 4 years before I could study IT in my school. But it was totally worth it. Every day I spend at least two hours at my computer. So IT is a huge part of my life. I’m highly involved in gaming, but also in assembling computers for my friends. I assembled my first PC not that long ago: 4 months ago. In class I made networks, wrote my first programs, configured Windows and Linux. I also designed websites, not major ones, but smaller ones for myself just for fun. My first experience with programming was amazing. I could make a computer say something like “Hello, world!” for the first time in my life. It really made me think about all the possibilities. Now I know several programming languages and I’m happy I do. But, I’m nowhere near an expert. I’m still making mistakes but I’m learning from them. I won’t make the same mistake twice.</p>

<h1 id="the-future:4c5b3b485fa30b2f5b47fbff7329b01f">The future</h1>

<p>I don’t know where the future will bring me. There are so many options for me. Two major paths: networking/system management  or software design. I like both of them, but I think networking and system management will be easier for me. Software design like programming is a very hard thing to do.  I wouldn’t mind getting in the software branch, it’s just that I think it’s better as a hobby than having it as a job.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion:4c5b3b485fa30b2f5b47fbff7329b01f">Conclusion</h1>

<p>IT has a very big part in my life. I really hope that in the near future I will be able to have a great job which involves IT.</p>
